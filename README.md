A platform-independent WiFi scanning library for getting BSSID + RSSI from nearby access points. It should work on most Linux installations as well as Windows and OS X.

## How does it work?

*wifiscan* works by calling the OS-specific Wifi scan utility and parsing the output. For Linux this is `iwlist`, for Windows it is `netsh.exe` and for OS X it is `airport`. Other systems are not supported at the moment (although, as long as they are Linux-based I believe you can install `iwlist`).

## Install

```
go get -u github.com/zeroby0/wifiscan/...
```

## Usage 

You can use it in your Go code as:

```golang
wifis, err := wifiscan.Scan()
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
for _, w := range wifis {
    fmt.Println(w.SSID, w.RSSI)
}
```

You can also use the command-line tool as:

```
$ WIFI=wlan0 wifiscan
SSID                RSSI
f0:5c:19:a2:2a:01   -55
28:c6:8e:75:6f:cf   -58
f0:5c:19:a2:26:61   -72
90:72:40:1c:b8:96   -69
...
```

_Note:_ When using with Linux you will need to add `sudo` to get a full scan.
